    <h1>My Journey as a Full-Stack Developer</h1>
    <p>
      I have just started my journey as a full-stack developer. At the
      beginning, everything seemed difficult and confusing. But I have a strong
      passion for learning and creating useful web applications. I know that
      success doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, effort, and patience. I
      am currently learning the basics of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript, and back-end tools like PHP, MySQL, and Node.js. Every
      day, I try to write code, solve problems, and build small projects to
      improve my skills. My dream is to become a professional full-stack
      developer who can create complete and powerful websites. I want to work on
      real-world projects, help people through technology, and grow in this
      exciting field. I know there will be challenges, but I believe in myself.
      With hard work and consistency, I will reach my goal.
